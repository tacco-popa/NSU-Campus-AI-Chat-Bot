I completed my  \nDual M.S. in computer science and journalism in 2016 with distinction from Columbia. I graduated  \nsumma cum laude in B.S. in Computer Science from North South University, Dhaka, Bangladesh in  \n2012. After that I worked at Computer Vision and Cybernetics Group, Bangladesh  \n(http://www.cvcrbd.org/researchers). My interdisciplinary research works are based on digital image  \nprocessing, machine learning, fuzzy logic, neural networks and data mining. My previous research  \nworks have appeared in numerous prestigious conferences and journals, namely, IEEE\u2019s 2012  \nInternational Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics (ICMLC), ACM\u2019s 13th International  \nConference on Enterprise Information Systems (ICEIS), International Journal of Healthcare  \nInformation Systems and Informatics (IJHISI), to mention a few. In 2015, I co-authored a book chapter  \non hospital surveillance data analysis in Springer\u2019s \u2019Intelligent Information and Database Systems\u2019.  \nThe story of post-2015 can be found in my publication and funding list below my bio.  \nMy present research is based on real time triangulation of mass calamities using NASA\u2019s satellite  \nimagery and also perception of visual data by artificial intelligence. A more ambitious research I have  \nundertaken is detecting and classifying violent action in surveillance and cell phone videos.  \nI was also the recipient of the Genius Hunt Competition held by ACM in 2011 for my work in Bengali  \nspeech recognition.  \nOn a different note, I am using DataCamp for independent learners for my Junior Design class in  \nSummer 2017. It is an excellent platform to assign online courses on many CS areas. I highly  \nrecommend you check it out if you are a teacher (or a student). Harvard and Princeton are already on  \nboard in case you were wondering. They provide their premium content to universities and yours truly  \navailed it and have been getting very good feedback from students.  \nThe easy going happy-go-lucky faculty member (me!) invites your emails and presence at his office  \nhours if you want to talk about research, computer science, political science and of course \u2013 Star  \n\nWars.  \nResearch Areas  \n\u25aa Signals and Image Processing  \n\u25aa Artificial Intelligence & Robotics  \n\u25aa Database and Information Systems  \n\u25aa Modeling and Simulation  \nResearch Interests  \n\u25aa Digital Image Processing  \n\u25aa Computer Vision  \n\u25aa Machine Learning  \n\u25aa Visual Data Mining  \n\u25aa Streaming Data  \n\u25aa Fuzzy Logic and Fuzzy Systems  \n\u25aa Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning  \n\u25aa Computational Journalism  \n\u25aa Intelligent User Interfaces  \nTeaching  \n\u25aa CSE 173 Discrete Mathematics  \n\u25aa CSE 215 Programming Language II  \n\u25aa CSE 311 Database Systems  \n\u25aa CSE 311L Database Systems Lab  \n\u25aa CSE 445 Machine Learning  \n\u25aa CSE 465 Pattern Recognition and Neural Network  \n\u25aa CSE 573 Theory of Fuzzy Systems  \n\u25aa EEE 521 Neural and Fuzzy Systems  \n\u25aa EEE 565 Pattern Recognition  \n\u25aa CSE 467 Digital Image Processing  \n\u25aa EEE 660 Computer Vision Systems  \nSelected Publications  \n\nJournals  \n\u25aa Adnan Firoze, Tousif Osman, Shahreen Shahjahan Psyche, Tonmoay Deb, Rashedur M  \nRahman, \u201cA synthetic approach to estimate cognitive aesthetic of framed images  \nand improvements taking human\u2019s psychology into account,\u201d Journal of Information  \nand Telecommunication \u2013 Taylor & Francis.

Besides working as a full-time faculty at  \nNSU ECE \u2013 I also worked as a Co-ordinator for School of Engineering and Physical Sciences (SEPS) at  \nNSU Career and Placement Center (CPC), leading industry-academia collaboration for School of  \nEngineering from 2018 to 2020.  \nCurrently, I am a doctoral candidate in School of Computer Science (SCS), University of Waterloo, ON,  \nCanada and on an academic leave from North South University.  \nMy current research area focuses on exploring interaction modalities for gesture-sensing earable (i.e.,  \near-mounted wearable) devices. During my doctoral research, I collaborated with Huawei Human \nMachine Interaction (HMI) lab in Markham, ON, Canada.  \nMore info about my current research area and research group in University of Waterloo can be  \nfound here.  \nI am well experienced in Agile SCRUM/XP/Kanban, Incremental / RAD / V-model Software  \nDevelopment Life Cycle (SDLC), Software Version Controlling, Software Project Management / Bug  \ntracking / Quality Assurance process, and well-acquainted with Continuous Integration / Deployment  \n(CI/CD) & build automation process. As a software engineer \u2013 I received best employee award at SRBD  \nfor Software Development work on Samsung Rex 70 Middle East Asia (MEA) release in 2013.  \nIf you are considering approaching me for a Letter of Recommendation (LOR) for graduate school or  \nprofessional reference, please read this guideline.  \nI can be reached via the following emails outside of NSU:  \n\u25aa skshimon[at]alumni[dot]colostate[dot]edu  \n\u25aa ssarefin[at]uwaterloo[dot]ca  \nResearch Areas  \n\u25aa Human Computer Interaction (HCI)  \n\u25aa Software Engineering  \n\n\u25aa Mobile, Wireless and Web Applications Development  \nResearch Interests  \nData Science & Analytics  \n:  \nData Visualization & Interaction, Data Pipeline  \nHuman-Computer  \nInteraction (HCI)  \n:  \nAugmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Large Screen Surface Displays  \n(Tabletops, Public Display, Automotive displays), Mobile & Wearable Devices &  \nInteraction.  \nComputer Supported  \nCooperative Work (CSCW)  \n:  \nCollaborative Educational Technology  \nSocietal Computing  \n:  \nComputing Technology & Policy, Computing for Social Good  \nIf you are interested in working with me, send me an email  \nat <shaikh[dot]shimon[at]northsouth[dot]edu> .  \nPlease read the guideline for communicating with me as a current NSU student.  \nNote: A great way to understand if a faculty is a good fit for working with on research is to do a course  \nunder him.  \nIf you already have done a course under him/her, you are well aware of the faculty\u2019s supervision style  \nand the faculty is well aware of your potential as a hard worker.  \nTeaching  \n\u25aa CSE 498/EEE 498/ETE 498 Internship/Co-op/Directed Research  \n\u25aa CSE 486 Mobile and Wireless Application Development  \n\u25aa CSE 427 Software Quality Assurances & Testing  \n\n\u25aa CSE 373 Design and Analysis of Algorithms  \n\u25aa CSE 332 Computer Organization and Architecture  \n\u25aa CSE 299 Junior Design Course  \n\u25aa CSE 225 Data Structures and Algorithms  \n\u25aa CSE 225L Data Structures and Algorithms Lab  \n\u25aa CSE 215 Programming Language II  \n\u25aa CSE 215L Programming Language II Lab  \n\u25aa CSE499A/EEE499A/ETE499A \u2013 Senior Design I  \n\u25aa CSE499B/EEE499B/ETE499B \u2013 Senior Design II  \nSelected Publications  \nJournals  \n\u25aa Shaikh Shawon Arefin Shimon, Ali Neshati, Junwei Sun, Qiang Xu, Jian Zhao, \u201cExploring  \nUni-manual Around Ear Off-Device Gestures for Earables,\u201d Proceedings of the ACM on  \nInteractive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies, Volume 8, Issue 1, 2024  \nConference Papers  \n\u25aa Shaikh Shawon Arefin Shimon , Courtney Lutton , Zichun Xu ,Sarah Morrison-Smith ,  \nChristina Boucher , Jaime Ruiz, \u201cExploring Non-touchscreen gestures for  \nsmartwatches,\u201d CHI '16 , 2016  \n\u25aa Shaikh Shawon Arefin Shimon , Sarah Morrison-Smith , Noah John , Ghazal Fahimi , Jaime  \nRuiz, \u201cExploring  \nUser-Defined  \nDevices,\u201d MobileHCI'15, 2015  \nBack-Of-Device  \nGestures  \nfor  \nMobile  \n\u25aa Mohammad Rayed, Tawfique Elahi, SHAIKH SHAWON AREFIN SHIMON, Nova  \nAhmed, \u201cMFS Design in Appstore-enabled Smart Featurephones for Low-literate,  \nMarginalized Communities,\u201d CHI2023, 2023  \n\nProfessional Activity  \nCareer coordinator, School of Engineering & Physical Science (SEPS)  \nCareer & Placement Center (CPC), North South University  \n(June 2018- June 2020) \n\n", "last_modified": 1739385509.0}]
